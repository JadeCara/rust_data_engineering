## Description
This repository is a central hub for exploring data engineering concepts using Rust. It includes various projects and examples to demonstrate effective data handling and processing techniques. Modified from instructor [NoahGift's repository](https://github.com/nogibjj/rust-data-engineering) which was used in the [Rust Programming Specialization Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-engineering-rust).

## Usage
To try out the examples in the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/JadeCara/rust_data_engineering.git`
2. Navigate to the directory of the example you would like to try: `cd rust_data_engineering\module<number>\<example_name>`
3. Install the dependencies: `cargo build`
4. Run the example: `cargo run`

> [!Tip]
> Some examples have additional arguments that need to be passed in to run. These will be noted at the top of the src/main.rs file.
